    <h2>Thyroid Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located in the neck. It produces hormones that regulate various functions in the body, including metabolism, heart rate, and body temperature.
    </p>

    <h2>Causes of Thyroid Problems</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1. <strong>Hypothyroidism:</strong> When the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. It can be caused by autoimmune disorders, iodine deficiency, or certain medications.</li>
      <li>2. <strong>Hyperthyroidism:</strong> When the thyroid gland produces an excess of thyroid hormones. It can be caused by Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, or inflammation of the thyroid gland.</li>
      <li>3. <strong>Thyroid Cancer:</strong> Abnormal growth of cells in the thyroid gland can lead to thyroid cancer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prevention</h2>
    <p>
      While some thyroid conditions are not preventable, there are steps you can take to promote thyroid health:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. <strong>Ensure Adequate Iodine Intake:</strong> Iodine is essential for thyroid hormone production. Include iodine-rich foods in your diet, such as iodized salt, seafood, and dairy products.</li>
      <li>2. <strong>Eat a Balanced Diet:</strong> Consume a well-balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to support overall health.</li>
      <li>3. <strong>Manage Stress:</strong> Chronic stress can affect thyroid function. Practice relaxation techniques and engage in activities that reduce stress levels.</li>
      <li>4. <strong>Regular Check-ups:</strong> Visit your healthcare provider for regular check-ups and thyroid function tests.</li>
    </ul>
